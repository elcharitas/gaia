# Gaia: Pipeline Management and Monitoring

Gaia is a robust software system for managing and monitoring complex pipelines with precision. Built with Rust for performance and reliability.

## Project Structure

This workspace contains the following crates:

- **gaia-core**: Core library with pipeline definition, execution, and state management
- **gaia-cli**: Command-line interface for interacting with Gaia
- **gaia-monitor**: Service for real-time monitoring of pipeline execution
- **gaia-web**: Web dashboard for visualizing pipeline status and metrics

## Features

- Define complex pipelines with dependencies between tasks
- Monitor execution status and performance metrics
- Handle failures with configurable retry and fallback strategies
- Visualize pipeline execution through CLI and web interfaces
- Scale from simple workflows to complex distributed pipelines

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/elcharitas/gaia.git
